      <h2> About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m Adeosun Semiat, a dedicated and detail-oriented Virtual Assistant based in Lagos, Nigeria, with over a decade of experience in administration, education, and customer service. I pride myself on delivering proactive and reliable support that helps businesses and teams stay organized, efficient, and focused.

In addition to my virtual assistance expertise, I have developed skills as a Junior Web Developer through the Power Learn Project, where I studied software engineering with hands-on coding. I am proficient in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and experienced in backend development using Node.js, Express, and database management to build dynamic, data-driven websites and applications.

My technical skills include Microsoft Office Suite, Google Workspace, Canva, CorelDRAW, CRM platforms such as HubSpot and Zoho, as well as web development tools and backend technologies. Whether managing schedules, handling customer inquiries, coordinating virtual meetings, or developing and maintaining websites, I approach every task with professionalism and attention to detail.

I am passionate about helping businesses grow by providing seamless virtual assistance and digital solutions that make operations run smoothly. My goal is to empower clients to focus on their core activities while I handle the behind-the-scenes tasks with care and efficiency.
